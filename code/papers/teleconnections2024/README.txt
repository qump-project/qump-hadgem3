These steps will be needed to run the notebook.

1. Build the conda environment as instructed in the notebook.
2. Untar the data to a directory.
3. Copy qumpy_lite.py from https://github.com/qump-project/qump-hadgem3/blob/master/code/papers/UKWinterPrecip2023/qumpy_lite.py
4. Create a file called control_natlwinter.py which sets a string variable called indir to be the base directory where the data has been stored (after un-tarring).
